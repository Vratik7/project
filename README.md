## **Project Overview**

### **Objective:**
Create a data-driven analysis of a music streaming platform, "Spotify Clone." This project aims to simulate the process of analyzing user behavior, music preferences, and trends, just like data analysts at Spotify would. The goal is to derive insights that can help improve user experience, recommend songs, and drive business growth.
